# Bacillus Genome-Scale Metabolic Model Continuous Validation with Memote


This is a Memote repository for a genome scale model of *Bacillus* (CSC052) that is part of the CarbStor community.
Current and past reports can be found at https://pnnl-predictive-phenomics.github.io/csc052

## Overview

This repository contains the continuous validation environment for an organism-specific genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) using Memote. Memote is a software tool that provides a suite of tests to ensure the quality and consistency of metabolic models. By integrating Memote into a continuous integration (CI) workflow, we can automatically validate updates to the GEM, ensuring that model modifications improve or maintain the model's integrity.

## Features

- **Automated Testing**: Utilize Memote for automated testing of metabolic model properties such as stoichiometric consistency, gene-protein-reaction (GPR) associations, and reaction SBO terms.
- **Continuous Integration**: Integrate with CI platforms like GitHub Actions or Travis CI to run Memote tests on every commit, ensuring model quality over time.
- **Version Control**: Track changes to the GEM using Git, allowing for revertible updates and collaborative development.
- **Memote Report**: Generate and store Memote history reports to visualize the model's quality over time and identify areas for improvement.
- **Documentation**: Detailed instructions for setting up the environment, running tests, and interpreting Memote reports.

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/pnnl-predictive-phenomics/csc052-gem.git
   cd csc052
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run Memote Tests Locally**
   ```
   memote run --filename "model.xml" --pytest-args "-v"
   ```

4. **Set Up Continuous Integration**
   - Configure your CI tool of choice by following the provided CI configuration guide.

5. **Interpret Results**
   - Review the output of Memote tests and reports for insights into model quality and validation status.
